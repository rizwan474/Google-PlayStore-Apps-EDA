# Google-PlayStore-Apps-EDA
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on Google Play Store apps. Through comprehensive data exploration and visualization, the project aims to uncover valuable insights into app categories, ratings, reviews, and trends within the Google Play Store ecosystem. 
## About Dataset
##### **Context**

While publicly available datasets for Apple App Store apps are abundant on platforms like Kaggle, finding equivalent datasets for Google Play Store apps proves to be more challenging. Unlike the iTunes App Store, which offers a structured and easily scrapeable appendix-like layout, the Google Play Store employs more advanced web technologies such as dynamic page loading using JQuery. This modern approach complicates data extraction through traditional web scraping methods, requiring more sophisticated techniques to collect and analyze comprehensive data on Google Play Store apps.

##### **Content**

Each app (row) has values for catergory, rating, size, and more.

##### **Acknowledgements**

This information is scraped from the Google Play Store. This app information would not be available without it.

##### **Inspiration**

The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success. Actionable insights can be drawn for developers to work on and capture the Android market!
